        <h2>How to Play Snake's Appetite</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Snake's Appetite! Can you help the snake grow and satisfy its hunger for square-shaped apples? Here's how it works:</p>

        <h3>Game Start:</h3>
        <p>The game is so eager to begin that it starts automatically! No need to press any keys; just sit back, relax, and watch the snake slither into action.</p>

        <h3>Gameplay:</h3>
        <p>Your keyboard's arrow keys control the snake's direction. Left, right, up, and down - choose wisely to guide the snake towards those square-shaped apples (we told the snake they were round, but it insists they're square).</p>
        <p>Please note: This arrow key magic is exclusive to desktop users. We're terribly sorry, mobile users; the snake needs its arrow keys!</p>

        <h3>Game Rules:</h3>
        <p>The game has a few rules to keep in mind:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If the snake touches the game screen's borders or collides with its own body, it's game over. The snake has a complicated relationship with walls and itself.</li>
            <li>Each time the snake snacks on an apple, it will grow longer (and even rounder, although it still thinks they're square).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Scoring:</h3>
        <p>Your score will increase with each apple the snake devours. Try to achieve the highest score possible and keep the snake's appetite satisfied!</p>

        <h3>Snake's Preferences:</h3>
        <p>The snake is colorblind, so it can't see the apples' square shape - it just knows they're delicious!</p>
